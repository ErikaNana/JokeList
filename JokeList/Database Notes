ID column
---------
-in many tables, the ID column represents the primary key
-the primary key is the key that uniquely identifies the row entry object
-when designing an SL table, specify the primary key as an integer and mark it as
auto-incrementable: this way every inserted row is guaranteed to have a unique primary key

Not null constraint
-------------------
A column with a NOT NULL constraint cannot have NULL values

Creating a table
-------------------
To create a table, we give a name to a table and to its columns. Each column can have one of these data types:

NULL - The value is a NULL value
INTEGER - a signed integer
REAL - a floating point value
TEXT - a text string
BLOB - a blob of data

example:
sqlite> CREATE TABLE COMPANY(
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
   NAME           TEXT    NOT NULL,
   AGE            INT     NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS        CHAR(50),
   SALARY         REAL
);

Drop Table
---------
Drop Table statement is used to remove a table definition and all associated data, indexes, triggers, constraints and permission
specifications for that table
